                    Music is generally defined as the art of arranging sound to create some combination of form,
                    harmony, melody, rhythm or otherwise expressive content. Exact definitions of music vary
                    considerably around the world, though it is an aspect of all human societies, a cultural
                    universal. While scholars agree that music is defined by a few specific elements, there is no
                    consensus on their precise definitions.Music often plays a key role in social activities, religious
                    rituals, rite of passage ceremonies, celebrations, and cultural activities. The music industry
                    includes songwriters, performers, sound engineers, producers, tour organizers, distributors of
                    instruments, accessories, and sheet music. Compositions, performances, and recordings are assessed
                    and evaluated by music critics, music journalists, and music scholars, as well as amateurs.

            <p class="sectiontag headline">Music History</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag containt">It is often debated as to what extent the origins of music will ever be
                understood,and there are many competing theories which aim to explain it.Many scholars highlight a
                relationship between the origin of music and the origin of language, and there is disagreement
                surrounding whether music developed before, after, or simultaneously with language. A similar source of
                contention surrounds whether music the intentional result of natural selection or was a byproduct
                spandrel of evolution. The earliest influential theory was proposed by Charles Darwin in 1871, who
                stated that music arose as form of sexual selection, perhaps via in mating calls. Darwin's original
                perspective has been heavily criticized for its inconsistencies with other sexual selection methods,
                though many scholars in the 21st century have developed and promoted the theory. Other theories include
                that music arose to assist in organizing labor, improving long-distance communication, benefiting
                communication with the divine, assisting in community cohesion or as a defence to scare of predators.In
                some musical contexts, a performance or composition may be to some extent improvised. For instance, in
                Hindustani classical music, the performer plays spontaneously while following a partially defined
                structure and using characteristic motifs. In modal jazz the performers may take turns leading and
                responding, while sharing a changing set of notes. In a free jazz context, there may be no structure
                whatsoever, with each performer acting at their discretion. Music may be deliberately composed to be
                unperformable, or agglomerated electronically from many performances. /p>

            <p class="sectiontag headline">Musician</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag containt">A musician is a person who composes, conducts, or performs music.
                According to the United States Employment Service, "musician" is a general term used to designate one
                who follows music as a profession. Musicians include songwriters who write both music and lyrics for
                songs, conductors who direct a musical performance, or performers who perform for an audience. A music
                performer is generally either a singer who provides vocals or an instrumentalist who plays a musical
                instrument. Musicians may perform on their own or as part of a group, band or orchestra. Musicians
                specialize in a musical style, and some musicians play in a variety of different styles depending on
                cultures and background. A musician who records and releases music can be known as a recording artist.A
                composer is a musician who creates musical compositions. The title is principally used for those who
                write classical music or film music. Those who write the music for popular songs may be called
                songwriters. Those who mainly write the words for songs may be referred to as lyricists. A conductor
                directs a musical performance; conducting has been defined as "the art of directing the simultaneous
                performance of several players or singers by the use of gesture." The conductor stands on a raised
                podium and communicates with the musicians through hand gestures or eye contact. Examples of performers
                include, but are not limited to, instrumentalists and singers who perform for an audience. A musician
                can perform as a solo artist or as a part of an ensemble.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag headline">Album</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag containt">An album is a collection of audio recordings issued on compact disc (CD),
                vinyl, audio tape, or another medium such as digital distribution. Albums of recorded sound were
                developed in the early 20th century as individual 78 rpm records collected in a bound book resembling a
                photograph album; this format evolved after 1948 into single vinyl long-playing (LP) records played at
                33+1⁄3 rpm.
                The album was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption from the mid-1960s to the
                early 21st century, a period known as the album era.Vinyl LPs are still issued, though album sales in
                the 21st-century have mostly focused on CD and MP3 formats. The 8-track tape was the first tape format
                widely used alongside vinyl from 1965 until being phased out by 1983 and was gradually supplanted by the
                cassette tape during the 1970s and early 1980s; the popularity of the cassette reached its peak during
                the late 1980s, sharply declined during the 1990s and had largely disappeared during the first decade of
                the 2000s. In the Western art music tradition, improvisation was an important skill during the Baroque
                era and during the Classical era. In the Baroque era, performers improvised ornaments, and basso
                continuo keyboard players improvised chord voicings based on figured bass notation. As well, the top
                soloists were expected to be able to improvise pieces such as preludes. In the Classical era, solo
                performers and singers improvised virtuoso cadenzas during concerts. </p>
